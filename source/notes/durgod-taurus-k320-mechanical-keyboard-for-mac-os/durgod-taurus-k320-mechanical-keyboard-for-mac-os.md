After pondering with the idea of getting a mechanical keyboard for a while, earlier this year I bit the bullet and ended up with the [Durgod Taurus K320](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Durgod-Taurus-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Space-Grey/dp/B081LZQ7R7).

The Taurus K320 is primarily a Windows keyboard and I'm a Mac OS user. For the most part, this isn't a problem and requires a tiny bit of tinkering to get it working properly. 

The only downside to this is that the right `Fn` key doesn't work with Mac OS, it's a dud. This doesn't bother me but may bother other people. 

I had to remap some of the keys, I found a fantastic free tool called [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) which makes it super easy to remap keys, among other things. In Karabiner, you can remap another key to use as `Fn`. 

Although mechanically everything was working great, I had the unthinkable cosmetic problem of having a Windows Key on my Mac keyboard ðŸ˜³. 

I hunted around and to my surprise, I found very little PBT keyboard keys available to solve my problem, luckily [I found these keys](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000138763106.html). 

It won't be to everyone's liking but I'm very happy.
