I use a lot of <i>stuff</i> in my day-to-day life, some of which can be found on this page.

I love full manual older lenses. You can get extremely well built lenses with great glass for cheap (compared to modern alternatives). I enjoy using them, it makes me think.

## Desktop Applications & Tools

I use a mix of open-source software, leased, and commercial software. 

### Development

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - My editor of choice right now, can't really fault it.

- [iTerm 2 Nightly](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads/nightly/#/section/home) - I prefer the customisation options you get with iTerm, also the global hotkey is a must.
- [SequelPro](https://www.sequelpro.com/) - Use for all my relational database needs, used it for years.
- [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) - Whenever I need to quickly get into a server and see what I'm doing.
- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com) - Crunching images for the web, save some space or strip personally identifiable metadata.
- [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac/) - The only Git client I have ever needed.

### Design

- [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) - Been using it for years for UI design, I've heard of the rest but I'm happy and productive with Sketch.
- [Iconset](https://iconset.io/) - I have a few open-source icon collections stored in Iconset, it's scary how much I use this app.
  - [Iconcons](https://ionicons.com/)
  - [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/)
  - [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/)
  - [Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)

### Photography/Photo Editing

- [Lightroom Classic](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html) - I hope Adobe don't kill this. I don't mind Lightroom CC but I hate that your library has to live on the cloud.

### Misc
